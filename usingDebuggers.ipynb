    "A debugger is a way  interacting with your code as it is running.  One thing that beginners love about python is the fact that you can run commands interactively from the terminal shell, making it very easy to explore variables and syntax.  In this sense, the interpreter shell is a debugger.  The notebook environment is also very interactive, as you can enter `print` statements, rerun cells, and inspect your code and the values generated along the way.\n",
